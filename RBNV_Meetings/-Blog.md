## Mastering KiCad for Robotics PCB Design

### Comprehensive Tutorials and Practical Applications  
Doug led an in-depth session on KiCad, focusing specifically on its application to robotics-oriented PCB design. Central discussion points included:

- **Effective Schematic Setups:**  
  Whether you're designing for hobbyist projects or advanced robotics applications, learning to configure schematic setups correctly is paramount.

- **Creating and Managing Net Classes:**  
  Detailed guidance was shared on setting up net classes and assigning footprints, vital for ensuring accuracy in designs and simplifying the routing process.

- **Hands-On Practice:**  
  Attendees engaged in practical exercises, adjusting schematic characteristics and exploring strategies for efficient layout organization. Special attention was given to:
  - **Footprint Library Creation:** A deep dive into generating custom footprints for modules not found in default libraries.
  - **PCB Layout Optimization:** Techniques for organizing board layouts to reduce noise and improve power distribution, paving the way for more reliable and efficient designs.

### Troubleshooting and Advanced Routing  
Troubleshooting is an inevitable part of PCB design, and the session did not disappoint:
- **Error Identification and Correction:**  
  Participants learned how to swiftly detect and rectify issues such as missing connections or design rule conflicts.
- **Leveraging Auto Routers:**  
  Tools like FreeRouting were showcased, highlighting how automation can streamline the design process and minimize human error.
