# Demystifying KiCad for Robotics PCB Design: A Recap from DPRG's Robot Builders Night Virtual

In the March 4th, 2025 session of the Dallas Personal Robotics Group's (DPRG) Robot Builders Night Virtual, members dove deep into the world of PCB design using KiCad—a powerful, open-source tool crucial for today's robotics projects. Led by Paul Bouchier, the discussion navigated the complexities of setting up a project, creating custom libraries, refining PCB layouts, and ultimately preparing designs for fabrication. Whether you're a seasoned roboticist or just starting out, this session offered valuable insights into optimizing your PCB designs for innovative robotics applications.

## Setting Up for Success

A well-organized project forms the backbone of any successful PCB design. Paul Bouchier kicked off the session by guiding participants through the initial setup of a KiCad project tailored for robotics. Key takeaways included:

- **Directory Organization:** Establishing dedicated folders for components, footprints, symbols, and 3D models to maintain clarity and promote reusability.
- **Project Structuring:** Emphasizing a systematic approach from the very beginning to avoid future complications as the complexity of the design increases.

## Creating Custom Libraries and Symbols

One of the session's highlights was learning about the creation of custom component libraries. Robotic projects often require unique components that may not be available in standard databases. Paul demonstrated how to:

- **Build Custom Libraries:** Develop and manage project-specific libraries that cater to unique components.
- **Design Custom Symbols:** Create tailored symbols for components absent from standard libraries, ensuring every part of your PCB is accurately represented.

This process not only enhances flexibility but also ensures that your design processes are better aligned with the specific demands of robotics projects.

## PCB Layout, Signal Clarity, and Net Classes

Effective PCB layout is critical to functional robotics design. The session delved into practical aspects of arranging components to ensure optimal performance, including:

- **Component Placement:** Strategic layout planning to maintain signal clarity and minimize electromagnetic interference.
- **Net Classes Utilization:** Employing net classes to define trace widths, clearances, and other electrical properties. This step is essential for maintaining the integrity of high-speed signals and ensuring reliable operation in complex robotic systems.

## Balancing Auto-routing with Manual Precision

While KiCad’s auto-routing capabilities can speed up the design process, the session underscored that manual intervention remains indispensable. Key points included:

- **Auto-routing Advantages:** Quick estimation of routing paths which can save significant time.
- **Manual Tweaks:** Critical adjustments are often necessary to address issues such as isolated ground planes or spacing violations. These manual refinements ensure that the final PCB layout meets stringent reliability and performance standards.

## Preparing Designs for Fabrication

Transforming a digital design into a tangible PCB is an exciting final step in the engineering process. Paul’s walkthrough covered:

- **Generating Gerber Files:** Detailed instructions on how to export your design files accurately for manufacturing.
- **Utilizing Gerber Viewers:** Leveraging online Gerber viewers for error checking and design verification before sending the board for fabrication.
- **Ordering Fabricated Boards:** A brief tour of the JLPCB website, demonstrating how to streamline the ordering process for quick turnaround and high-quality results.
