# Robot Builders Night Virtual for April 1st, 2025

## Introduction
The meeting began with a light-hearted April Fools theme and quickly transitioned to updates from various members on their robotics projects and technical advancements. Key highlights include demonstrations of AI-driven email archive search, real-time robot vision processing, and advanced ROS navigation applications.

## Main Discussion Points

### 1. AI Email Archive Search
- **Steve Edwards** showcased his project involving the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI to facilitate searches through the DPRG email archives.
- Discussion on the benefits of dense vs sparse indexing, with improvements in metadata usage for better search results.
- A proposed plan for integrating the search into a web interface, offering a potentially valuable tool for members.
- The project is available for public access on [GitHub](https://github.com/sedwardstx/DprgArchiveAgent), promising further enhancements.

### 2. Robot Vision Processing
- **Pat Caron** demonstrated his progress on a robot vision system using OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi. His system successfully identifies and tracks cans in a simulated environment.
- He detailed using LAB color space for consistently picking out orange cans under varying lighting conditions and plans to implement stereo vision for depth perception.

### 3. ROS2 Navigation and Simulation
- **Mike Williamson** presented advancements in using ROS2 Nav2 for robot navigation simulation. 
- Demonstrated the creation of a '6-can world' in Gazebo simulation software and navigation among obstacles.
- Highlighted challenges with localization and sensor fusion using LIDAR and Time-of-Flight sensors for real-world application.
- Mike is progressing through an online course in ROS2, furthering his expertise in robotic navigation systems.
