## Deep Dive into KiCad for Robotic PCB Design

A highlight of this session was the practical, hands-on exploration of KiCad, a free and open-source electronic design automation (EDA) tool that's making waves in the robotics community.

### What Was Covered:

- **Schematic and Layout Mastery:**  
  Paul Bouchier, supported by Doug Parody, guided participants through the process of setting up schematics, creating custom net classes, and fine-tuning graphical properties. They demonstrated:
  - How to assign and customize footprints and symbols.
  - The importance of differentiating net classes and adjusting trace widths between power and signal lines for precision routing on PCBs.

- **Navigating KiCad's Version Transitions:**  
  Doug shared insightful tips to address challenges during upgrades—from version 6 through 7 and beyond. Key takeaways included:
  - Techniques for flavoring schematics with color-coding.
  - Tweaking design rules for optimal PCB layout.
  - Effective troubleshooting strategies for common issues like unassigned power flags and extra no-connect (NC) labels.

- **Hands-On Exercises:**  
  Participants engaged in interactive sessions where they:
  - Created and modified project files.
  - Configured KiCad schemas.
  - Generated Gerber files for PCB production.
  
  These exercises underscored the importance of verifying designs through export checks and visual validation using Gerber viewers, reinforcing the principle that meticulous design equals robust engineering outcomes.
