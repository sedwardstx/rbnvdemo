# Robot Builders Night Virtual for November 4th, 2025

## Introduction 
The meeting began with Pat Caron welcoming participants to the Robot Builders Night Virtual session, outlining the evening’s agenda, which included presentations from various roboticists, followed by a question-and-answer session.

## Main Discussion Points

### Mike Williamson's Robot Project:
- **Localization and GPS Integration**: Mike provided an update about his progress on integrating GPS with ROS 2 for his robot. He detailed the use of extended Kalman filters for local and global localization transformations and demonstrated his setup on GitHub.
- **Demonstration Challenges**: He shared experiences dealing with IMU calibration, lidar scanning, and time of flight sensors for robust navigation.
- **Real-world Testing**: Mike discussed obstacles encountered in real-world testing conditions, including sensor drift and calibration challenges.
- **Future Plans**: Plans to further investigate GPS integration issues and refine localization for outdoor testing were mentioned.

### Scott Gibson's Robotics Demonstration:
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Scott showcased his robot Belch's capabilities in obstacle avoidance and target acquisition (cone detection) using lidar and GPS coordinates to navigate effectively.
- **GPS and RTK Integration**: He discussed the use of RTK for precise navigation and demonstrated obstacle navigation as well as route planning for competition readiness.
- **Software Stability**: Scott emphasized improvements in software stability and usability, targeting a perfect score in upcoming competitions.

### Doug Paradis Presentation:
- **DFRobot Sensor Overview**: Doug demonstrated a new cost-effective sensor for robotic applications – an 8x8 array with simple interface options and a built-in microcontroller, suitable for indoor use.
- **OpenAI Codex Integration**: He shared insights on utilizing OpenAI Codex for simplifying coding tasks in Visual Studio Code, providing a live demonstration of its capabilities.

### Ray Casler's Quick Project:
- **Obstacle Avoidance Scheme**: Ray briefly demonstrated a quick prototype for obstacle avoidance using a PulseLite lidar sensor and a microcontroller, illustrating basic directional guidance logic.

## Conclusions and Insights
- Participants showcased different methods and technologies for improving robot navigation and obstacle avoidance, focusing on integrating sensor data for localization.
- Consensus was toward continuous iterative testing and development to tackle localization challenges, particularly for competitive events.
