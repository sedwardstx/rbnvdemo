# Robot Builders Night Virtual for November 25th, 2025

## Introduction
The Robot Builders Night Virtual meeting, held on November 25th, 2025, covered a range of robotics projects, competitions, and AI development tools. Participants shared updates on personal projects, discussed technical challenges, and explored the implications of new terms and conditions in popular platforms.

## Main Discussion Points

### Micro Mouse Project by Matthew Komitsky
- Matthew presented on updates to his high-speed maze-solving robot, including improvements in circuit board assembly and layout.
- He discussed the challenges of component sourcing and the strategic decision to use external PCB assembly to enhance build quality.
- Matthew is preparing for the upcoming competition in March and plans to build a maze according to Micro Mouse specifications.

### VEX Robotics Competition by Trish Cook
- Trish provided an update on her involvement with VEX Robotics teams and their participation in local and national competitions.
- The teams encountered challenges in adapting to different competitive strategies, particularly transitioning from offensive to defensive playstyles.
- Trish's nonprofit organization is organizing a major tournament in January, which sold out quickly, highlighting its success but also the logistical challenges involved.

### Copilot and AI Coding Tools
- Ray Casler shared his experiences and challenges using GitHub Copilot for project development, particularly with microcontrollers like Arduino.
- Participants discussed strategies for optimizing AI use, including prompt engineering, using multiple AI tools, and maintaining session continuity for better performance.
- There was a broader discussion about the limitations and advantages of AI-generated code and how different models can impact development outcomes.

### Discussions on Terms and Conditions
- The meeting concluded with a discussion about the updated terms and conditions for the Arduino IDE, which raised concerns about open-source viability and user rights.
- This led to a conversation about alternative development environments like Platform IO, which remains unaffected by these new terms.

### Miscellaneous
- Participants discussed practical challenges encountered in robotic competitions, such as sensor inaccuracies in outdoor environments.
- Mike Williamson shared lessons learned from his robot's performance in a recent competition, emphasizing the importance of simulation for pre-testing.

## Conclusions and Insights
- Effective use of AI tools in coding requires strategic setup and management, with an emphasis on using the correct models and maintaining a clear project plan.
- The evolving landscape of robotics competitions requires teams to remain adaptable, especially in the face of changing competition styles and environments.
- The changes in the Arduino IDE terms and conditions may drive developers towards alternative platforms to maintain open-source practices and user autonomy.
