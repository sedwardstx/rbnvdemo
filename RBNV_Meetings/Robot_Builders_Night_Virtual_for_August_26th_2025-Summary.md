# Robot Builders Night Virtual for August 26th, 2025

## Introduction
The virtual meeting on August 26th, 2025, gathered robotics enthusiasts to discuss ongoing projects and innovations. Key highlights include advancements in GPS accuracy, discussions on Raspberry Pi alternatives, ROS usage on Mac, and designing efficient brushless motors. Shared references enriched the discussion, linking to relevant information and products.

## Main Discussion Points

### Belch Project Update
- **Scott Gibson** worked on improving GPS accuracy for the Belch project, achieving 14mm precision using RTK. He encountered challenges with XB mesh network but managed successful point-to-point communication for telemetry and monitoring.
- Discussions extended to the optimal configuration of GPS antennas, addressing challenges like data drop during transmission due to radio issues.

### Raspberry Pi Alternatives
- **Scott Gibson and others** explored alternatives to Raspberry Pi, focusing on LuckFox boards. These are cost-effective, providing features like eMMC storage and modular pin configuration, posing as potential Raspberry Pi replacements.
- Concerns about ecosystem support and long-term viability were expressed, particularly in commercial applications.

### ROS and Mac Compatibility
- **Chris N** queried the group about running ROS and Arvis on Mac systems. The conversation highlighted challenges with virtualization and the possibility of using the Homebrew Robotics Group as a resource for similar inquiries.

### Designing Brushless Motors
- **Kyle Woolsey** expressed interest in designing efficient brushless motors for robot applications, seeking advice for maximizing performance and minimizing heat loss.
- The group advised caution, noting the complexity and potential high costs associated with custom motor designs, encouraging leveraging existing technology when possible.

## Conclusions and Insights
- **GPS Project:** Achieving millimeter-level accuracy can enhance project outcomes, but requires careful consideration of antenna placement and signal processing.
- **Pi Alternatives:** While intriguing, alternatives like LuckFox boards require thorough validation for compatibility and support in various applications.
- **ROS on Mac:** Experimenting with Linux subsystem setups or exploring dedicated ROS community resources may provide solutions for Mac users.
- **Motor Design:** Aspiring designers should evaluate the cost-benefit of buying versus building, especially when pursuing high-performance and precision-motor applications.
