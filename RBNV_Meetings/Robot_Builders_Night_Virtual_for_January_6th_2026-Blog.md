## Engaging Member Project Showcases

### Stephen’s R5 D2 Robot  
Stephen’s project, the R5 D2—a robot built on a sturdy plywood frame with differential drive—captured the community’s attention. Controlled through a web browser via an ESC32 interface, the potential integration of encoders to improve precision was a hot topic. Inspired by Doug’s insights from his experience with AliExpress motors, discussions around cost-effective upgrades and performance enhancements were abundant.

### Jim Phelan’s Stingray and Power Solutions  
Jim Phelan’s innovative Stingray project, crafted from acrylic and powered by a Raspberry Pi 5 paired with a specialized power hat from [52pi](https://52pi.com/collections/raspberry-pi-1/products/52pi-pd-power-extension-adapter-board-for-raspberry-pi-5), showcased advanced power supply management. His GitHub repository for the Stingray project further deepened community understanding and provided a platform for open collaboration.
