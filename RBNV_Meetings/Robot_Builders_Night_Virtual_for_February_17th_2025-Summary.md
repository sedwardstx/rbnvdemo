# Robot Builders Night Virtual for February 17th, 2025

## Introduction
The meeting focused on a mock judging session for the Iron Reign Robotics Team, specifically preparing for their presentation and the feedback from DPRG members. Several engineering concepts, designs, and strategies to optimize their robot's performance in competitions were discussed.

## Key Discussion Points

### Mock Judging Session Preparation
- Jai Sammpath led the session, explaining the purpose of the meeting as a mock judging session to receive feedback.
- The team discussed the importance of the "Inspire Award," awarded to teams who perform well overall. Teams must excel in multiple categories rather than focusing on a single area.

### Robot Design and Innovation
- The team showcased their robot, Brooidon, highlighting its flexibility and unique design features aimed at optimizing performance in sample collection during competitions.
- Innovated with a triangular carbon fiber chassis to enhance maneuverability.
- Challenges with iterative designs were highlighted, such as the transition from a crane mechanism to a more reliable worm gear system for the robot's arm.

### Challenges and Improvements
- Issues with heavy existing chassis led to a decision not to pursue a new design until potential downsides are properly evaluated.
- Emphasized continuous improvement with each iteration, such as switching from a string-based to a more stable coaxial shoulder joint.

### Presentation and Feedback
- Detailed feedback was provided on the team's presentation style and slide layout for clarity.
- Suggestions for improving slide comprehension and aligning content with key messages were shared.
- Emphasis was placed on ensuring slides contain meaningful and concise text that can stand alone during rapid presentation transitions.

### Automation and Technological Integration
- Discussed the automation of routines to improve driver efficiency during competitions.
- Leveraged advancements in hardware, like the Limelight smart camera, for better visual detection and navigation.

### Outreach and Community Engagement
- The Iron Reign Team highlighted their community engagement, including hosting educational events and summer camps.
- Deliberate efforts were made to increase younger student involvement in STEM areas.

## Conclusions and Insights
- The Iron Reign team was highly commended for their innovative ideas, strong community outreach, and comprehensive approach to both technical and non-technical aspects of robotics competitions.
- Improvements in presentation styles and focus on content clarity were recommended to enhance judgment day success.
- Continued focus on enhancing robot agility and incorporating feedback-driven improvements is advised.
