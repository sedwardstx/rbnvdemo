# Meet the Innovators: Highlights from Robot Builders Night Virtual – March 25th, 2025

Welcome to another exciting edition of Robot Builders Night Virtual recaps! This past meeting saw an energetic exchange of ideas and a showcase of groundbreaking projects by our community members. With dynamic project updates, upcoming event announcements, and even a few quirky creative demos, the Dallas Personal Robotics Group (DPRG) once again proved why it’s at the forefront of robotics innovation.

## Engaging Announcements & Event Updates

### Power Lunch at Ford's Garage
One of the first updates came with an announcement about an upcoming Power Lunch event. Originally scheduled on a different day, the meeting clarified that the event will now be held on Sunday at Ford's Garage. This change promises a more accessible setting where robotic enthusiasts can network and share ideas over a hearty meal.

### VEX Robotics Interview Preparation
Trish Cook highlighted the need for volunteers to assist in preparing for the VEX Worlds Championship interviews. With standardized questions and a detailed rubric in hand, the DPRG is rallying support to help her three VEX teams shine on the world stage. Volunteers are encouraged to participate in both virtual practice sessions and in-person preparations in May, ensuring the teams are well-prepared for their big moments.

## Showcasing Technical Mastery: Project Updates

### Line Tracker Robot by Tom Crawford
Tom showcased his innovative line tracker robot, built around the ESP8266 and equipped with IR sensors. This agile robot, capable of distinguishing surface colors, is undergoing further experiments to enhance its tracking precision.
