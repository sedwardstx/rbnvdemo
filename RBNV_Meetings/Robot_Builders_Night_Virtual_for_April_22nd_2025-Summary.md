# Robot Builders Night Virtual for April 22nd, 2025

## Introduction
The Robot Builders Night Virtual meeting on April 22nd, 2025, was a gathering of robotics enthusiasts discussing various projects, insights, and technical challenges. Attendees shared updates on ongoing projects, explored innovative ideas, and leveraged AI tools to enhance robotics capabilities.

## Main Discussion Points

### DPRG Updates and Gathering of Robots
- Paul Bouchier announced the upcoming Gathering of Robots event coinciding with the Dallas Maker Space open house, inviting participants to showcase their robots and participate in contests.
- Members discussed preparations for the event, including setting up contest courses.

### GPS Antenna Cable Modification
- Ted Meyers shared experiences in modifying GPS antenna cables for better length management. He described the process of shortening cables and improving connections using a cable crimper.
- Scott Gibson provided insights on the importance of correct torque specifications for SMA connectors to improve signal performance.

### Robotics Projects and Demonstrations
- **Scott Gibson's Robot Innovations**: Scott introduced his new robot "Number Nine," equipped with Beagle Bone Blue and new hardware for improved can collection and localization using lidar and sensors.
  
- **Mike Williamson's ROS Advances**: Mike showcased methods to toggle ROS lidar localization for navigation tasks, highlighting its use in various competition courses.

### AI and Code Generation
- **Mark R's Animatronic Eye Mechanism**: Mark used an AI tool, Aider, to develop an Arduino sketch controlling animatronic eyes without manually writing code, demonstrating the automation potential in robotics programming.
  
- **AI Tools for Programming**: Paul Bouchier shared insights on different AI tools like Aider, Copilot, and Cursor, comparing their effectiveness in assisting programming tasks. The tools aid in generating, modifying, and optimizing code.

### Harold Pulcher's Mobile Mr. Big Head
