## Innovating with Robot Design: Meet Brooidon

The highlight of the meeting was the introduction of Brooidon, Iron Reign’s latest robotic creation designed for sample collection in competitive environments. Some of the standout innovations included:

- **Triangular Carbon Fiber Chassis:**  
  The new chassis design enhances maneuverability, allowing the robot to execute sharp turns and navigate complex course layouts more effectively.

- **Iterative Design Improvements:**  
  The team shared their journey of trial and error, moving from an unsteady string-based approach to a more robust coaxial shoulder joint system. Additionally, a shift from a cumbersome crane mechanism to a reliable worm gear system demonstrated their commitment to performance under pressure.

These choices not only improve the robot’s functionality but also underline the importance of adaptability in design—a key takeaway for any engineering endeavor.
