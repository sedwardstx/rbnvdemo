# Robot Builders Night Virtual for February 22nd, 2025

## Introduction
The latest virtual meetup for the Dallas Personal Robotics Group (DPRG) was held on February 22nd, 2025. Paul Bouchier and other members discussed various topics ranging from election updates, upcoming events, and in-depth demonstrations on using KiCad for creating PCBs relevant to robotics projects. This is an overview of the main discussion points and insights shared during the meeting.

## Main Discussion Points

### 1. DPRG Elections and Updates
- **Election of New Officers:** The group conducted a special election to fill positions on the board. Eric was elected to a new officer position, and Mark was welcomed as the new vice president, succeeding Carl Aught.
- **Upcoming Workshops and Events:** Attendees discussed plans for future events, including a run in April for the Dallas Maker Space open house, and ongoing projects like Roby the Robot to be showcased at upcoming expos.
  
### 2. KiCad Tutorials for Robot Design
- **Using KiCad:** Doug provided an extensive tutorial on using KiCad for PCB design tailored for robotic applications. 
  - The session covered schematic setups, creating net classes, and assigning footprints.
  - Participants were given hands-on practice in creating and adjusting schematic characteristics for their projects.
- **Practical Applications:** Discussions included practical advice on footprint library creation, routing, and adjustments specific to the needs of modular robotics hardware.
  
### 3. Technical Setup and Prototypes
- **Hardware Organization:** Emphasis was placed on how to organize layouts on PCBs to reduce noise and improve the efficiency of power distribution across the board.
- **Custom Footprints:** The necessity of creating custom footprints for specific modules that are not available in default libraries was highlighted.
  
### 4. Troubleshooting and Adjustments
- **Troubleshooting in KiCad:** The session incorporated fixes and identification of errors like missing connections and adjusting errors from design rules.
- **Using Auto Routers:** Leverage of tools like FreeRouting demonstrated improvements in efficiency of board designs.

## Conclusions and Insights
- Participants gained a deep dive into the practical aspects of using KiCad for robotic PCB development. 
- The necessity for precise schematic and net class setup to avoid future complications in assembly or functionality was reinforced.
- Upcoming events promise to extend practical applications showcased at the meeting, aiming especially at hands-on community contribution and demonstrations.
