# Robot Builders Night Virtual for March 4th, 2025

## Introduction
The latest session of the Dallas Personal Robotics Group's (DPRG) Robot Builders Night Virtual focused on the intricacies of using KiCad for designing PCBs for robotics. Led by Paul Bouchier, the group navigated through setting up a project in KiCad, creating custom libraries, assigning net classes, and preparing for PCB fabrication.

## Key Discussion Points

### Initial Setup and Project Organizing
- Paul Bouchier guided participants through the setup of a KiCad project for a hypothetical robot PCB design.
- Emphasis was placed on creating organized directories for components, footprints, symbols, and 3D models.

### Creating Custom Libraries and Symbols
- Attendees learned how to create custom libraries in KiCad for project-specific components.
- The process for setting up symbols for components that do not exist in the standard KiCad libraries was demonstrated.

### PCB Layout and Design
- Detailed instructions were provided on how to layout components on a PCB, taking into consideration signal clarity and minimizing interference.
- The group explored the use of net classes to define trace widths and other properties.

### Auto-routing and Manual Adjustments
- The benefits of using auto-routing features in KiCad were highlighted, although manual adjustments were still necessary to ensure optimal routing.
- Discussions included troubleshooting common issues such as isolated ground planes and spacing violations.

### Preparing for Fabrication
- Instructions on generating Gerber files for manufacturing were given, along with a tour of the JLPCB website for ordering fabricated PCBs.
- The use of Gerber viewers for error checking and design verification was also covered.

## Conclusions and Insights
- KiCad proves to be a versatile tool for PCB design in robotics, capable of handling complex layouts and custom components.
- Proper organization and methodical setup are crucial for successfully using KiCad, especially for projects with unique components.
- Attendees now have a solid foundation to explore further PCB design ventures with a better understanding of how to utilize KiCad effectively.
