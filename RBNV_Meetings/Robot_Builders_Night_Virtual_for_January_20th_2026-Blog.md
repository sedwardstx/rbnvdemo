# Innovative Sparks: Highlights from Robot Builders Night Virtual – January 20th, 2026

The Dallas Personal Robotics Group (DPRG) gathered online for an engaging session on January 20th, 2026, showcasing a blend of nostalgia, cutting-edge technology, and inspiring community initiatives. From discussions on recent robotics competitions to experiments with affordable sensor technologies, this meeting offered a gateway into the evolving landscape of robotics and its potential to inspire the next generation of engineers.

## A Community-Driven Future: DPRG Annual Meeting Announcements

Kicking off the evening, organizers announced the upcoming DPRG Annual Membership Meeting to be held on January 24th at the Dallas Maker Space. With officer elections and brainstorming sessions on the agenda, the meeting promises to be a hub of networking and idea-sharing. This annual rendezvous is not just an event—it’s a testament to the group's commitment to fostering a collaborative and supportive robotics community.

## Celebrating Youth and Competition: High School Robotics Competition Recap

A major highlight of the session was the detailed recap of a large-scale robotics competition led by Trish Cook. Held at the Irving Convention Center, the event saw participation from 92 high school teams spanning 10 states. Key points include:

- **Impressive Participation:** The sheer number of teams underscores the growing enthusiasm for robotics among young innovators.
- **Rigorous Judging:** Club members acted as judges, meticulously reviewing projects and engineering notebooks—a practice that may soon see revised rules given the expansive nature of submissions.
- **Media Spotlight:** The competition was featured on [NBC 5](https://www.nbcdfw.com/video/news/local/something-good/high-school-robotics-teams-compete-in-robot-rodeo/3970504/), accentuating its significance and widespread impact.

Harold Pulcher’s reflections highlighted how such competitions not only bolster technical skills but also ignite passion and commitment among budding roboticists, setting them on promising future trajectories in technology.

## Diving Into Tech: Exploring Affordable Sensor Solutions

The session also ventured into the realm of robotics technology with insights from Tom Crawford. He shared his experiments using April tags with an ESP32 CAM—an economical solution that delivers impressive results in localization and object detection. The discussion pitted April tags against QR codes, emphasizing the nuances in their functionalities:
  
- **April Tags vs. QR Codes:** While both serve as fiducial markers, their capabilities differ. April tags are particularly suited for robust localization tasks, making them a favorite for emerging robotics applications.
