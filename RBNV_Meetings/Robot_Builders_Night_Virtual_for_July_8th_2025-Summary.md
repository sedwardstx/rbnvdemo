# Robot Builders Night Virtual for July 8th, 2025

## Introduction
The Robot Builders Night Virtual meeting held on July 8, 2025, focused on sharing updates on various robotics projects, discussions about technical challenges, and showcasing advancements in AI and control systems. The session welcomed multiple presenters who shared their work and sought advice on overcoming specific technical hurdles.

## Meeting Discussions

### Stepper Motor Control for Milling Machine
- **Michael Ivison** showcased his project involving adding a stepper motor to a milling machine. 
- He faced challenges with integrating an LCD display while maintaining smooth motor operation.
- Suggestions were offered on using hardware interrupts and potentially refactoring the code to reduce blocking operations. Michael also discussed the possibility of incorporating RAMPS boards for enhanced control.

### Robo Columbus Car Project
- **Mike Williamson** detailed his work on a car for Robo Columbus, focusing on serial communication between a radio receiver and motor controller.
- The integration involved decoding telemetry to read battery levels and RPMs.
- He discussed potential solutions like adding rotary encoders or using alternative angle sensors to better monitor vehicle speed.

### Art Installation Control
- Mike shared his plans for an art platform requiring precise rotation synchronization with projection content.
- He explored using Open Show Control (OSC) protocols for coordinated media control and discussed using Arduino libraries for implementation.

### AI and Control Discussions
- Discussions included the use of AI models for aiding with programming challenges.
- Carl Ott introduced the concept of scheduled tasks within GPT models and their applications in preparing daily briefings or automated reminders.
- The group explored energy consumption impacts of AI tools with humorous speculation on environmental consequences.

### Home Security Camera Project
- **Tom Crawford** updated the group on his development of a camera system using high-definition power over Ethernet (PoE) cameras and Zone Minder software.
- His focus was on leveraging AI for motion detection, object recognition, and energy-efficient server setups for home surveillance.
