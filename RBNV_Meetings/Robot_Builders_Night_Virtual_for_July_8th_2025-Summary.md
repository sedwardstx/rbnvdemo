## Meeting Discussions

### Stepper Motor Control for Milling Machine
- **Michael Ivison** showcased his project involving adding a stepper motor to a milling machine. 
- He faced challenges with integrating an LCD display while maintaining smooth motor operation.
- Suggestions were offered on using hardware interrupts and potentially refactoring the code to reduce blocking operations. Michael also discussed the possibility of incorporating RAMPS boards for enhanced control.

### Robo Columbus Car Project
- **Mike Williamson** detailed his work on a car for Robo Columbus, focusing on serial communication between a radio receiver and motor controller.
- The integration involved decoding telemetry to read battery levels and RPMs.
- He discussed potential solutions like adding rotary encoders or using alternative angle sensors to better monitor vehicle speed.

### Art Installation Control
- Mike shared his plans for an art platform requiring precise rotation synchronization with projection content.
- He explored using Open Show Control (OSC) protocols for coordinated media control and discussed using Arduino libraries for implementation.

### AI and Control Discussions
- Discussions included the use of AI models for aiding with programming challenges.
- Carl Ott introduced the concept of scheduled tasks within GPT models and their applications in preparing daily briefings or automated reminders.
- The group explored energy consumption impacts of AI tools with humorous speculation on environmental consequences.

### Home Security Camera Project
- **Tom Crawford** updated the group on his development of a camera system using high-definition power over Ethernet (PoE) cameras and Zone Minder software.
- His focus was on leveraging AI for motion detection, object recognition, and energy-efficient server setups for home surveillance.
