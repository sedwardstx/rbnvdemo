# Innovative Solutions and Collaborative Spirit Shine at the October 28th Robot Builders Night Virtual

The latest Robot Builders Night Virtual session on October 28th, 2025, delivered a wealth of insights into cutting-edge robotics and electronics projects. From retrofitting doorbell systems to developing maze-solving robots and designing dynamic ball launchers, the meeting showcased diverse projects and innovative solutions while reinforcing the community’s collaborative ethos.

## A Warm Welcome and Event Updates

The session kicked off with a lively welcome and a reminder about the upcoming Robo Columbus event—a must-attend for robotics enthusiasts looking to network and explore new technological frontiers. This set the stage for a series of technical deep-dives that captivated both experienced builders and newcomers alike.

## Key Project Discussions

### Tom Crawford's Doorbell System Upgrade

Tom Crawford introduced his ambitious project aimed at breathing new life into an old doorbell system by enabling it to play real music. Key technical details included:

- **Hardware and Software:**  
  Leveraging an ESP 8266 microcontroller, Tom integrated an 8-bit DAC and a shift register. He converted wave files to an 8-bit mono format using Audacity and utilized the LittleFS file system to manage audio playback.
  
- **Challenges and Solutions:**  
  Initially, variable latency with LittleFS and issues during Arduino and ESP 8266 integration (due to IDE limitations on serial transfers) presented significant hurdles. The solution was a streamlined approach featuring simpler interrupt routines and a single-byte buffer system, which helped resolve many latency and crash issues.

This project is a perfect example of how system-level challenges can be overcome through methodical testing and creative engineering. It also highlights the practical integration of legacy systems with modern microcontrollers.

### Matthew Komitsky's Micro Mouse Project

Matthew Komitsky’s Micro Mouse project is gearing up for competitive maze-solving challenges. His update included:

- **PCB and Motor Integration:**  
  Matthew is designing a custom PCB tailored for small-scale motors with integrated encoders, essential for precision control in maze navigation.
  
- **Hands-On Assembly:**  
  Due to the small volumes involved in prototyping, he relied on manual SMT soldering. A notable challenge was solder bridging during PCB assembly, which he mitigated by developing a manual pick-and-place process to ensure accuracy.

Looking ahead, hardware testing is slated to begin as new components arrive, with a competitive debut aimed for March. This project reminds us that innovation often lies in precise, hands-on work and careful assembly techniques.

### Fernando's Iron Rain Robotics Launcher

In another engaging segment, Fernando presented his Iron Rain Robotics Launcher project—a creative take on a ball-launching mechanism intended for robotics competitions. Key points included:

- **Technical Challenges:**  
  Fernando’s initial tests revealed stability issues, such as flywheel wobbling, insufficient power, and unpredictable ball trajectories.
  
- **Proposed Enhancements:**  
  The community discussion centered on potential solutions, including:
  - Implementing dual flywheels for enhanced stability.
  - Adjusting friction material to improve power transfer.
  - Experimenting with compression and friction scenarios or even introducing a belt drive system.

Fernando’s iterative approach to refining the design underscores the trial-and-error nature of robotics development, with each tweak contributing to more reliable performance in competitive settings.

### Mastering SMD Soldering with Dave Ackley

Adding a hands-on educational component to the meeting, Dave Ackley demonstrated advanced SMD soldering techniques:

- **Techniques Showcased:**  
  Using fine-tipped soldering irons, tweezers, and adequate flux, Dave showcased methods for hand soldering Surface Mount Devices. His live demonstration provided practical tips on tip selection and mitigating thermal effects during soldering.
  
- **Community Exchange:**  
  Participants engaged in a fruitful discussion about best practices, reinforcing the importance of precision and careful handling in electronics assembly. For more in-depth soldering tips and tricks, check out [Mr. Solder Fix’s YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mrsolderfix3996).

This segment not only reinforced fundamental soldering skills but also embodied the spirit of peer learning, crucial to mastering complex electronic assembly.
