# Robot Builders Night Virtual for December 2nd, 2025

## Introduction
The Dallas Programmable Robotics Group convened for another engaging session of Robot Builders Night Virtual, marking December 2nd, 2025, as a day of intensive discussions. The meeting covered various aspects of robot building, including updates on ongoing projects, insights from trials in robotics competitions, and explorations of innovative concepts and materials.

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Progress and Challenges in Mini Sumo Robot Design
- **Mike Williamson** shared updates on designing a mini-sumo robot with off-the-shelf parts, focusing on compactness and performance within constraints like size and component space.
- Discussions involved the placement and function of sensors, circuit board design, and navigating design challenges like sensor placement and battery size considerations.
- **Karim Virani** and **Mark Dombrowski (madone)** contributed practical advice for optimizing sensor use and managing physical constraints.

### 2. Innovations in Six-Can Robotics Challenge
- **Ray Casler** presented a novel approach involving an air-powered propulsion system to enhance speed in the Six-Can challenge, sparking discussions about its potential efficiency and related safety concerns.
- The group humorously debated alternative power sources, like steam, and considered the practicality of these ideas in live competitions.
- Attention was given to regulatory concerns, particularly with the proposed use of high-pressure systems and alternative propulsion methods.

### 3. Advances in Robotics Components and Manufacturing
- **Matthew Komitsky** updated on the development of a micro-mouse robot, revealing design iterations and the complexities of optimizing motor control and PCB design.
- Discussion revolved around the cost and fabrication challenges, particularly tariff impacts, with insights from his experience ordering parts and assembling his project.
- **Tom Crawford** introduced cost-effective time-of-flight sensors as potential assets for projects demanding precise distance measuring capabilities.

## Conclusions and Insights
- Continuous innovation and peer feedback are crucial in overcoming common robotics challenges, especially in design and component integration.
- Cost considerations remain a significant challenge when sourcing materials for robotics projects, highlighting the need for strategic planning and resource management.
