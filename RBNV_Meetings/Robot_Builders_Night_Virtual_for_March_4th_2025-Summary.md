# Robot Builders Night Virtual for March 4th, 2025

## Introduction
The Dallas Personal Robotics Group (DPRG) hosted a virtual session focused on a variety of topics related to robotics and PCB design using KiCad. Key activities included elections for new board members, upcoming events, discussions on KiCad tools, and an in-depth workshop on creating a PCB for robotics applications.

## Main Discussion Points

### Elections and New Board Members
- Paul Bouchier announced the results of a special election to fill new officer positions within the DPRG.
- Eric was elected to a new board position, replacing the librarian role.
- Carl Aught stepped down as vice president, and Mark was welcomed as a new board member.

### Upcoming Events
- A presentation on the Lino Robot 2 software stack, which integrates with ROS 2, is scheduled for March.
- A robot run event is planned to coincide with the Dallas Maker Space open house in April, aiming to showcase robotics to potential new members.

### Robotics Project Presentations
- Doug led a detailed workshop using KiCad for PCB design targeted towards robot design.
- The focus was on creating a modular motherboard for robotics applications, covering schematic creation, PCB layout, and setting up net classes.

### RoboShowcase Planning
- Discussions were held on assembling and preparing 'Robbie', an exhibit robot, for various upcoming shows, including the DMS open house.
- Paul suggested creating a video and documentation on assembling Robbie to ensure long-term usability.

## Conclusions and Insights
- KiCad is an essential tool for DIY PCB creation in robotics, with participants being encouraged to download practice files from the DPRG website.
- Proper setup of net classes and footprints is crucial for successful PCB design.
- Engaging potential new members through showcases and hands-on activities like the robot run is valuable for community growth.
- Collaborative efforts in assembling exhibit robots like Robbie can enhance public demonstrations and member engagement.

## Referenced Links
- Participants were directed to download practice project files from the DPRG website for hands-on learning during the session.

The session successfully combined administrative updates with technical insights and practical activities, reinforcing the community's commitment to both governance and innovation in robotics.
