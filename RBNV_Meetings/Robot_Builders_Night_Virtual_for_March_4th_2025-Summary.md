# Robot Builders Night Virtual for March 4th, 2025

## Introduction
The Dallas Personal Robotics Group hosted a virtual meeting focused on discussing electronics design using KiCad for robotics projects. The meeting involved interactive tutorials on schematic and PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design, discussions about upcoming group events, and handling library components. Elections for the group's board positions and future events were also covered within the session.

## Meeting Summary

### Elections and Group Updates
- **Election Results**: 
   - Eric was elected to a new officer position on the board.
   - Mark was welcomed as a new board member, replacing Carl Aught who stepped down as vice president.

- **Upcoming Events**:
   - March Presentation: Paul Bouchier to present on Lino Robot 2 software stack using ROS 2.
   - April Event: Organized robot run to coincide with the Dallas Maker Space open house, featuring a "Roboama" exhibit.
   - Future Projects: Reassemble the robot "Roby" for exhibitions.

### KiCad for Robotics 
- **Introduction to KiCad**: 
  - Doug Parody led a session on using KiCad for creating schematics and designing PCBs, with step-by-step interactive components where participants followed along.

- **PCB Design**:
  - Discussion on using KiCadâ€™s PCB editor to organize board design with focus on net classes, wiring lessons, and understanding trace dimensions necessary for maintaining proper electrical connections and mechanical integrity.
  - Techniques for creating symbols and footprints for electronic components were shared, as well as how to import them into the KiCad project library.

- **Practical Exercises**:
  - Participants engaged in exercises on setting net classes, assigning footprints, routing techniques, and conducting electrical rule checks (ERC) and design rule checks (DRC) within KiCad.

- **Troubleshooting & Optimization**:
  - Insights were provided for dealing with common issues in KiCad, such as dealing with pin configurations and optimizing PCB layouts to minimize errors.

### Key Tools and Concepts Discussed
- **Auto-routing and Manual Adjustments**:
  - Utilizing auto-routing tools within KiCad to streamline the PCB design process efficiently, while maintaining the importance of manual checks.
  
- **Component Libraries**:
  - Leveraging online resources to find pre-existing component footprints and designs; tips on verifying their integrity prior to inclusion into a project.

- **Gerber Files and Manufacturing**:
  - Preparing and exporting Gerber files for PCB manufacturing; considerations around using service providers like JLCPCB for cost-effective production.

- **Mechanical Considerations**:
  - Additions of mounting holes and edged cuts, with a focus on producing prototypes that function well mechanically as well as electronically.

## Conclusion
The meeting successfully provided participants with key insights and practical experience into designing and building PCBs using KiCad for robotic applications. It emphasized the value of mastering both automated functions and manual interventions within the design software. Future events promise further exploration into robotics software and hardware integrations.
