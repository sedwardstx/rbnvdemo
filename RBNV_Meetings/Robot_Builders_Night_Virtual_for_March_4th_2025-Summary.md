# Robot Builders Night Virtual for March 4th, 2025

## Introduction
The session covered a range of topics, from technical issues encountered with specific robotic platforms to insights on building and customizing robotics hardware. Participants shared their experiences with software platforms, sensors, and discussed new technologies that could enhance robotic projects.

## Main Discussion Points

### OpenBot Platform Challenges
- **Ray Casler** discussed difficulties with OpenBot where video features were ahead of the code available on GitHub.
- Features missing included more comprehensive sensor integration such as GPS.
- Ray explored MIT App Inventor as an alternative for sensor integration, although it still had limitations.

### MIT App Inventor
- Participants examined the potential of MIT App Inventor for controlling robotic components, especially for educational purposes.
- Integrations with sensors like gyroscopes and accelerometers were discussed, but the platform faced limitations in supporting more advanced sensors.
- **Kareem Virani** shared insights on using Android Studio for more robust applications beyond educational use.

### Roby the Robot Rebuild
- **Paul Bouchier** and others worked on reviving "Roby," the DPRG mascot, integrating its components and ensuring functionality.
- Discussions on mechanics involved in its restoration and controlling mechanisms.
- Participants expressed intentions to improve aesthetics and functionality using more modern tools and parts.

### Robot Design and Navigation
- **Mike Williamson** shared progress on a new robot utilizing CAD models for enhanced visualization.
- The robot employs a combination of LiDAR, camera, and sensors for navigation within a known environment (non-SLAM).

### Challenges with LiDAR and Localization
- **Chris N** shared issues with ROS localization when robots turn quickly, losing track of location due to LiDAR limitations.
- Common solutions include rate-limiting rotation and compensating for distortions in LiDAR data.
- Discussion on using simulation environments for testing reflected the complexity of replicating real-world challenges.

### Autonomous Vehicle Development
- **Tom C** highlighted the progress of Waabi, a Toronto-based company working on autonomous navigation systems for trucks, marking significant advancements in commercial autonomy solutions.
  
## Conclusions and Insights
- While platforms like OpenBot show promise, they often lag in updates and may require supplementary tools for full functionality.
- Using tools like MIT App Inventor is beneficial for educational environments but may not meet all requirements for advanced projects.
- Successful revival and modernization of robotics projects like Roby require collaborative input and modern tooling.
- LiDAR and sensor simulation remain complex, with the integration of accurate modeling yet to be fully realized, suggesting a gap in currently available simulation environments.
