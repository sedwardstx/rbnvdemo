# Meeting Summary: Robot Builders Night Virtual for March 4th, 2025

## Introduction
This meeting of the Dallas Personal Robotics Group focused on discussing current and upcoming projects, elections of new officers, and technical details around using KiCad for designing PCBs for robots. The session included a practical tutorial on KiCad, discussions on upcoming events, and the election process for group officers.

## Key Discussion Points

### Elections and Group Administration
- The group held an election for new officers, including Eric's candidacy for a newly created position on the board.
- Welcomed Mark as the new member of the board.
- Further plans to announce content for meetings over the next few months.

### KiCad Tutorial for Robot Design
- Paul Bouchier and Doug led attendees through a detailed tutorial on using KiCad for designing robot PCBs.
- Participants opened projects and worked on schematic setups, focusing on net classes and generating symbols.
- Emphasized the importance of organizing components on the board to minimize noise and efficiently use space.
- Discussed the process of setting trace widths and custom net classes based on current requirements.
  
### Upcoming Events and Projects
- Discussed plans for activities at the Dallas Maker Space open house, including running a robotics exhibit.
- Planned to showcase Roby, a robotic asset that will be restored, with the aim of completing repairs and documenting the assembly process.
- Proposed a new 'top-secret' robot project with detailed design outlines during the session.

### Technical Discussions and Practical Exercises
- Completed exercises in KiCad involving setting up projects, handling symbols, and preparing the final PCB layout for manufacturing.
- Demonstrated the use of auto-routing and manual placement of components to optimize the PCB design.
- Participants learned to use free online resources for finding module footprints and the nuances of custom pin configurations.

## Conclusions and Insights
- Attendees gained hands-on experience with KiCad, enhancing their skills in designing effective PCBs for robotics applications.
- Emphasized on community collaboration and sharing resources for efficient design and implementation.
- Continued focus on integrating newcomers into the group and promoting active participation in ongoing projects.
  
## Referenced Resources
- Ray Casler and others discussed accessing detailed instructions and files for KiCad on the DPRG website.
- Doug and Paul recommended SnapEDA and other resource sites for electronic footprints and design guidance.
- Encouraged using JLCPCB for cost-effective PCB manufacturing and assembled component options.
