# Robot Builders Night Virtual for March 4th, 2025

## Introduction
The Robot Builders Night Virtual session for March 4th, 2025, included discussions on robotics education tools, sensor integration, and advancements in self-driving technology. Participants exchanged ideas and provided updates on their current projects.

## Main Discussion Points

### OpenBot and MIT App Inventor
- Ray Casler shared his experiences with the OpenBot platform, highlighting issues with outdated software on GitHub compared to demonstration videos.
- He explored the potential of MIT App Inventor for accessing phone sensors, noting its compatibility with Android devices and limitations like absence of GPS support.
- The discussion also touched upon the challenges of integrating phone sensors with ESP32 microcontrollers.

### Robotic Projects and Demonstrations
- Paul Bouchier shared updates on "Roby," a robot being restored with new components, showcasing its mechanical capabilities and progress made by various contributors.
- Mike Williamson discussed his new robot for the Roborama competition, highlighting its design improvements, sensor integration, and software challenges encountered post-update.

### Challenges with Lidar and Navigation
- Chris N. and other participants discussed the difficulties of using Lidar sensors for navigation, particularly issues with data distortion during fast rotations.
- Methods to mitigate these issues included selectively shutting down data feeds during rapid movements and exploring faster-spinning Lidar units.
- The conversation expanded to consider the implications for high-speed autonomous vehicle mapping.

### Line Following and Lidar Technologies
- Tom C. shared his work on a line follower robot based on an ESP8266 chip, utilizing infrared sensors for navigation.
- Discussion included the use of solid-state Lidar for obstacle detection, specifically the challenges of range limitations and integration with existing robotics platforms.

### Advances in Autonomous Technology
- Tom C. also mentioned Waabi, a leading company in developing autonomous navigation software for full-sized vehicles, providing insights into their recent major contract in the USA.

## Conclusions and Insights
- Participants gained valuable insights into integrating phone sensors with robotics platforms, especially when dealing with compatibility and software version issues.
- The restoration of legacy robotics like Roby highlights the collaborative effort and expertise within the community.
- Exploring new lidar technologies could offer improved solutions for complex navigation challenges, although limitations must be addressed.
