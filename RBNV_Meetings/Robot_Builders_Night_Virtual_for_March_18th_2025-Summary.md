# Robot Builders Night Virtual for March 18th, 2025

## Introduction
The meeting commenced with Paul Bouchier welcoming participants and outlining the agenda, which included DPRG announcements and various presentations by members showcasing their projects. 

## Main Discussion Points

### ROS 2 Navigation and Lino Robot 2
- Paul Bouchier discussed the upcoming DPRG meeting focused on ROS 2 navigation and Lino robot 2, delving into navigation concepts and robot configuration.
- He also mentioned a power lunch meetup and called for volunteers to help Trish's robotics teams practice interviews for the VEX Robotics Contest.

### Robot Development Updates

#### Mike Williamson's Robot Project
- Mike showcased his GitHub repository, which includes documentation and code for his robot with two RP2040 microcontrollers handling sensors and wheel control.
- He discussed hardware configurations, power supplies, and issues with Wi-Fi affecting robot performance.
- Mike and Paul discussed timestamping transforms static transfroms and the challenges of maintaining localization in robot navigation.

#### Swerve Drive Project by Fernando (F3r214)
- Fernando presented the new swerve drive chassis with two swerve pods and omni-wheels for support.
- Discussions included potential upgrades for better belt tension and position feedback to prevent slippage.
- Brainstormed solutions for ensuring pod position reliability, including optical sensors and encoder designs.

### Troubleshooting and Improvements
- Chris N. and others discussed time synchronization issues between devices running ROS that can impact navigation performance.
- Doug P. highlighted the challenges of managing battery systems for robots with a focus on voltage regulation and BMS configurations.

### New Projects and Experiments
- Fernando shared a personal project involving upgrading an Ender 3 printer with Klipper for improved control via a web interface.
- Doug P. showed the PCB boards for his table-bot robot control and is working on integrating components such as motor drivers and encoders.
