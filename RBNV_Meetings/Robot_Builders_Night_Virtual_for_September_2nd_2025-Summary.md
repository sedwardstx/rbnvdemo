### Mike Williamson's Robot Update
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Mike has been improving his robot's ability to traverse indoor environments using multi-point time-of-flight (TOF) sensors arranged in an 8x8 array. These help the robot avoid obstacles like walls and better approach targets like cones.
- **Sensor Calibration Issues:** Participants discussed issues related to erroneous sensor readings, often due to reflections and calibration, particularly when sensors pick up speckles not corresponding to actual obstacles.
- **Environmental Navigation:** Mike’s robot uses a combination of LiDAR for navigation and TOF sensors for detailed obstacle detection. Challenges remain in filtering sensor data to eliminate false positives, such as irrelevant speckles above the floor.
- **Contribution to Configuration:** Doug P. and others suggested tactics like angling ultrasonic sensors slightly to improve accuracy and reduce erroneous reflections.

### RoboColumbus Competition Preparations
- **RTK and GPS Strategies:** The group explored the use of RTK GPS systems for competitions, weighing the benefits and challenges of accuracy versus system complexity. Differentiation of RTK GPS from traditional GPS and their implementation in robot navigation were key points.
- **Competition Rules Clarification:** Doug and others clarified aspects related to GPS and waypoints. Discussions revolved around allowable technologies, use of RTK GPS, and strategic planning regarding waypoint management during competitions.
- **Scoring System:** The RoboColumbus scoring was discussed, highlighting how challenges like using zero waypoints or no GPS can add complexity—and potentially additional points—to the contest.

### Technology and Tools
- **DF Robot RTK GPS Kit:** Doug P. showcased a new RTK GPS kit from DF Robot, noted for its affordability and simplicity, which could be advantageous for newcomers and educators.
  
### Innovative Concepts
- **Automated Trash Bins:** A humorous project involving robots as moving trash bins with smart detection systems sparked discussions on practical applications and the over-engineering of simple tasks.
