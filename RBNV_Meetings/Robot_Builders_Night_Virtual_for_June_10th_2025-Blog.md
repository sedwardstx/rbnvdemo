## Robo Columbus and the Challenge of Cone Detection

Mike Williamson kicked off the meeting by presenting his work on the Robo Columbus robot, which is equipped with an Oak-D Lite camera and leverages the ConeSlayer AI for cone detection. His demonstration highlighted:

- **Hardware & Software Integration:** The use of the Oak-D Lite camera provided the visual input essential for detecting traffic cones—a critical function for autonomous navigation.
- **Implementation Challenges:** Mike faced significant hurdles while integrating ConeSlayer with a Raspberry Pi, ultimately finding more success on a Linux workstation.
- **AI Model Adaptation:** While ConeSlayer shows promise, there’s room for improvement in adapting the AI model to different hardware platforms.
