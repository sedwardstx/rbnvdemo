## Upcoming Events to Watch

The DPRG has an exciting lineup of events on the horizon:

- **Lino Robot 2 Software Stack Presentation:** Scheduled for March, this upcoming presentation will explore the integration of Lino Robot 2 with ROS 2, shedding light on improved robotics functionalities and streamlined operations. For those unfamiliar with ROS 2 (Robot Operating System), you can learn more at the [ROS website](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/).  
- **Robot Run at the Dallas Maker Space Open House:** In April, a robot run event is planned to coincide with an open house at the Dallas Maker Space. This event promises to not only showcase innovative robotics projects but also serve as a welcoming stage for potential new members.

These events are set to enhance the connection between practical demonstrations and community engagement, fostering an environment where learning and collaboration go hand in hand.

## Diving Deep: PCB Design with KiCad

One of the standout sessions of the night was a detailed workshop led by Doug, which focused on using KiCad for PCB design tailored to robotics applications. Key aspects of the workshop included:

- **Modular Motherboard Creation:** Participants followed a step-by-step guide on designing a modular motherboard—a critical component in modern robotics.  
- **Design Techniques:** The workshop covered essential techniques such as schematic creation, defining net classes, and setting up precise footprints using [KiCad](https://kicad.org/), a powerful open-source PCB design tool used widely in the engineering community.  
- **Hands-On Learning:** To enhance learning, attendees were encouraged to download practice files directly from the DPRG website, allowing them to replicate and experiment with the designs in real-time.

For anyone interested in diving deeper into PCB design, this session provided a solid foundation while also offering advanced insights into practical considerations in robotics.
