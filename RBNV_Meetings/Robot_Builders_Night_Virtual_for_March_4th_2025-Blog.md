## Mastering PCB Design with KiCad

The technical core of the meeting revolved around a comprehensive KiCad tutorial, led by experts Paul Bouchier and Doug. Participants dove deep into the complexities of PCB design for robotics, gaining valuable insights and practical skills:

- **Getting Hands-On:** Attendees engaged in live exercises, from opening projects to setting up schematics—learning how to efficiently design and organize components on a PCB.
- **Optimizing Designs:** The duo emphasized creating custom net classes, setting ideal trace widths, and employing both auto-routing and manual component placements to optimize board performance.
- **Best Practices:** Discussions highlighted methods to minimize signal noise and maximize space efficiency, crucial for high-performance robotics applications.
- **Resource Sharing:** The session also pointed participants to free online resources, such as SnapEDA for footprint libraries and JLCPCB for cost-effective manufacturing—a treasure trove for both novices and seasoned engineers.

For robotics groups looking to enhance their PCB design skills, KiCad remains an indispensable tool. The tutorial not only demystified complex design aspects but also fostered a collaborative learning environment that underscores the strength of community-driven technical exploration.
