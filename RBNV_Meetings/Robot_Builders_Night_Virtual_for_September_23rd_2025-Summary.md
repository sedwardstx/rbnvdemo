## Introduction

The Robot Builders Night Virtual session on September 23rd, 2025, focused on a variety of robotics projects and collaborations with universities. Key topics included updates from the Dallas Personal Robotics Group (DPRG), overviews of robotics projects at UT Dallas and UT Arlington, and detailed discussions on specific robot builds and competitions.

## Main Discussion Points

### DPRG News and Events

- Paul Bouchier provided updates on upcoming events, including the DPRG's September monthly meeting, which will include Karim's demo on commanding robots using LLMs and Paul’s talk on Git and GitHub, and a show'n'tell.

### UT Dallas Robotics Club Overview

- David DuBay provided a tour of the UT Dallas Synergy Park facility, including the capstone projects, design studio, Makerspace, and various UTD robotics club activities.
- DuBay emphasized the need for mentorship and collaboration with experienced professionals for student projects.
- DuBay has been involved with the UTD robotics club for a year and a half, and wants his foundation to sponsor events for the club, with involvement/support in some way from DPRG members.
- Club leader Om discussed various projects the club has undertaken
- The group discussed possible collaboration with DuBay's foundation and university robotics clubs.
- Benefits to students could include experience with mentors, resume-building references and certificates

### UT Arlington Involvement

- Jason Cabrejos discussed UTA’s robotics club and its interest in participating in RoboColumbus and other DPRG competitions.
- UTA's focus is on the University Rover Challenge, with sub-competitions mirroring Robo Columbus' autonomous navigation tasks.
- DuBay said he'd be interested in engaging with / sponsoring the UTA robotics team as well as UTD - open to engaging with universities in the DFW metroplex area.

### Technical Discussions

- Mike Williamson shared insights into his robot build for Robo Columbus, detailing challenges with sensor placement and navigation software.
- There was a discussion on materials, such as polycarbonate versus acrylic, for sensor housing.
- Paul Bouchier showed his Maker's Pet ROS2/ESP32 Arduino robot displaying lidar data in rviz, and discussed motor issues which prevent it from running.

## Conclusions and Insights

- The discussions highlighted opportunities for collaboration between DPRG and university clubs, particularly in competitions that emphasize both mechanical and software aspects of robotics.
- There is a clear interest from both students and DPRG members in fostering mentorship opportunities and leveraging university resources for mutual benefit.
