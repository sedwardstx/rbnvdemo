# Robot Builders Night Virtual for February 22nd, 2025

## Introduction
The meeting commenced with various discussion topics related to the Dallas Personal Robotics Group (DPRG), covering election results, upcoming events, and technical tutorials, predominantly focusing on the use of KiCad for PCB design in robotics.

## Main Discussion Points

### Election and Announcements
- Paul Bouchier welcomed participants and discussed the results of a special election to fill board roles.
- Eric was elected to a new officer position, and Mark joined the board replacing Carl Aught as vice president.

### Upcoming Events and Projects
- Announced upcoming DPRG events including a robot run coinciding with the Dallas Maker Space open house in April.
- Discussion on reassembling the robot 'Robbie' for displays and exhibitions. Plans to document the assembly and create a protective storage solution.

### KiCad for Robot Design
- Doug Parody conducted an in-depth tutorial on using KiCad for PCB design, covering topics like schematic setup, net classes, and the integration of various modules and components.
- Instructions given on assigning pin types and using the symbol editor to create custom symbols for missing components.

### Practical Implementation
- The meeting included a practical walkthrough of setting up KiCad projects, such as creating and organizing directories and using plugins for simplified PCB layout design.
- Demonstration of using auto-routing tools to design efficient PCBs in KiCad, with discussions on net classes and their importance in electronics design.
- Issues and troubleshooting specific to KiCad toolkit were addressed, offering solutions and workarounds for known bugs.

### DFM (Design for Manufacturability) Verification
