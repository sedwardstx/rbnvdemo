# Robot Builders Night Virtual for February 22nd, 2025

## Introduction
The virtual gathering of the Dallas Personal Robotics Group (DPRG) took place on February 22nd, 2025. The meeting focused on project-based learning around robotics and electronics design using KiCad, a free software suite for electronic design automation (EDA).

## Key Discussion Points

### Election of New Officers
- A new officer position was filled by Eric, replacing the librarian role and another board position previously held by Carl Aught, now succeeded by Mark.
- Ron Grant supervised the online voting process, with 16 votes received.

### Upcoming Events
- Events planned include:
  - A presentation on Lino Robot 2 software stack by Paul in March.
  - An April robot run at Dallas Maker Space's open house, featuring a robot course setup.
  - Plans to restore and display the robotic entity "Robbie" at upcoming events like Moon Day.

### KiCad for Robot Design
- Paul Bouchier and Doug Parody led a practical session on using KiCad for designing robot motherboards.
- Topics covered included:
  - Schematic setup, net class creation, and how to adjust graphical properties.
  - Utilizing KiCad for creating and assigning footprints and symbols.
  - Differences in net classes and trace widths for power and signal routing on PCBs.

### Technical Challenges and Solutions
- Doug discussed the transition issues from KiCad version 6 to 7 and later versions.
- Several tips for using advanced KiCad features:
  - Flavoring schematic designs with color-coding and adjusting design rules for PCBs.
  - Understanding layout constraints for different components.
  - Troubleshooting common errors such as unassigned power flags and extra no-connect (NC) labels.

### Hands-on Exercises
- Participants engaged in exercises creating and modifying project files, configuring KiCad schemas, and generating Gerber files for PCB production.
- Emphasis was placed on the importance of verifying designs through exported files and visual tools like Gerber viewers.

## Conclusions and Insights
- KiCad is a powerful tool for custom PCB design but requires careful attention to version changes and community updates for optimal usage.
- Collaborative design sessions enhance learning and allow for shared problem-solving among robotics enthusiasts.
