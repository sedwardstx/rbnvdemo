# Robot Builders Night Virtual for March 25th, 2025

## Introduction
The Robot Builders Night Virtual meeting on March 25th, 2025, was hosted by Mark R. with various participants discussing ongoing projects, sharing progress updates, and seeking assistance. The meeting covered topics ranging from VEX World Championship preparations to ESP32 camera experiments and innovative DIY projects.

## Main Discussion Points

### VEX Worlds Championship Preparation
- **Trish Cook** announced that five teams have made it to the VEX Worlds Championship.
- Trish is looking for volunteers to help conduct virtual interview practice sessions for three of the teams before the actual interviews at Worlds, scheduled between May 6th and 8th.
- These sessions are important for team readiness, focusing on consistent feedback based on a rubric and practicing presentation skills for both virtual and in-person scenarios.

### Tom Crawford’s Line Following Robot
- Tom demonstrated his progress on a line-following robot using an ESP8266 microcontroller and IR sensor arrays.
- He shared insights into his experimentation with detecting lines using different colors and the impact of ambient lighting.
- Tom also discussed various technical challenges, such as analog signal sampling and sensor configuration for optimal line detection.

### Fernando's 2WD Swerve Platform
- **Fernando** showcased his progress on a two-wheel-drive swerve platform operated through RC control.
- The platform demonstrated basic movement, achieving decent functionality despite encountering some motor speed issues and potential misalignment concerns.
- Fernando plans to expand the project with additional modules to enhance its capabilities.

### Ray Casler’s ESP32 Camera Experiments
