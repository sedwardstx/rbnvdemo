# Robot Builders Night Virtual for May 13th, 2025

## Introduction
The Robot Builders Night Virtual meeting on May 13th, 2025, delved into upcoming robotics contests, shared insights on AI coding assistance, explored new technological tools, and discussed the impact of recent tariffs on importing components from China.

## Main Discussion Points

### Upcoming Robotics Contests and Events
- **Roboama**: Members are preparing for the Roboama event featuring contests like Quick Trip, line following, and a tabletop challenge.
- **Mini Sumo**: Scott is gearing up for mini sumo, while Mark is refining his code for participation.
- **Barrel Racing**: This new contest stirred interest for its flexibility in solving through odometry or distance sensors.
- **Four Square**: After participant interest, this contest has been officially added to the event lineup.

### AI and Robotics Programming Assistance
- A potential upcoming symposium on AI coding assistance for robotics was discussed, with emphasis on agent-based coding tools that do more than autocomplete.
- Members shared experiences with tools like GitHub Copilot and discussed challenges in AI-assisted coding reliability.

### New Technological Tools
- **Foxglove for ROS Applications**: Paul Bouchier demonstrated the capabilities of Foxglove as an alternative to RQT bag for better message inspection and debugging.
- **UV Printer by Eufymake**: The Kickstarter for a new 3D textured UV Printer was covered, highlighting its potential for craft and small business applications.

### Impact of Tariffs on Imports
- Participants expressed concerns about recent high tariffs on imports from China impacting accessibility and plans. Many are holding off on purchases due to uncertainty.

### Show-and-Tell: Robotics Projects
- **Scott Gibson**: Demonstrated a video of No. 9 running a six-can robotic challenge effectively using obstacle avoidance.
- **Mike Williamson**: Shared updates on his robot enhancements, featuring added hardware like a solid state drive and screen, with a practical demo of his four-corner navigation.

## Conclusions and Insights
- The club is actively engaging in competitions and pushing for innovation in their projects.
- AI tools for coding assistance offer potential but face challenges in real-world application scenarios.
- Turmoil due to tariffs has created a 'wait-and-see' approach towards new component purchases.
- Engagement with new technologies continues as members seek efficient solutions for robotics challenges.
