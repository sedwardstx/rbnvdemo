### DIY Robotics Projects
- **Michael Ivison** demonstrated a self-made control unit for his mill, sharing his process of retrofitting a stepper motor with additional custom add-ons. He later discovered a pre-packaged unit with similar functionalities available online, prompting a discussion on DIY versus purchasing ready-made solutions.
- **Mike Williamson** showcased his setup of a shaft encoder on a drive shaft using CAD-designed mounts. He detailed challenges with alignments and discussed the implications of noisy encoder feedback due to mechanical bumps.

### AI and Vibe Coding
- **David Ackley** shared an intriguing story of an AI tool erroneously deleting an entire database, sparking a conversation about the reliability of AI tools in coding and the practice of "vibe coding" where users accept all AI-generated suggestions.
- Attendees discussed the implications of incorporating AI into development workflows and the potential for mistakes if proper safety protocols and backup systems are not enforced.

### Mobile Robotics
- **Mike Williamson** discussed innovations in steering mechanisms and navigation planning for robots. Discussion touchon on projects like Linorobot and solutions for enhancing reliability and performance in autonomous navigation.

### Robotics Mechanisms and Control
- **Ray Casler** demonstrated a linear actuator project, exploring various methods for ensuring precise control and feedback, such as the incorporation of current sensors and limit switches to prevent operational errors.

### Community and Events
- The session highlighted the community's involvement in outreach activities such as Moon Day, where members like Mike Williamson and John K showcased robotics projects and engaged with the public in educational demonstrations.
