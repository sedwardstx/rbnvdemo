# Robot Builders Night Virtual for November 18th, 2025

## Introduction
The virtual meeting for the Dallas Programmable Robotics Group was packed with insightful updates and technical discussions focusing on robo-navigation, power management, and preparation for the upcoming Robo Columbus event. 

## Key Discussion Points

### Robo Columbus Preparations
- Pat Caron reminded attendees that Robo Columbus is just a few days away and encouraged everyone to get their robots ready.
- Mike Williamson shared detailed updates on his RoboColumbus robot, specifically about addressing transmission and power distribution issues. He successfully implemented a hot swap system between an external power supply and battery and shared his troubleshooting experiences with GPS navigation and tuning of ROS planners for improved path following.

### Power Management Challenges
- Kyle Woolsey and other members discussed issues related to power management, specifically around using buck converters to step down battery voltage for robotics applications.
- Kyle experienced failures with multiple buck converters and sought advice on proper loading and connections. The importance of loading and using reliable components was emphasized.
- The conversation included potential solutions such as ensuring minimum load resistance, using bench power supplies for safe voltage adjustment, and testing buck converters thoroughly before deployment.

### General Technical Discussions
- There were significant discussions about sensor integration, signal filtering, and robot control algorithms. Members exchanged ideas on IMU noise suppression, GPS alternatives, and filtering techniques.
- The importance of reliable components, as well as the challenges associated with counterfeit electronic parts, were emphasized, with references to past experiences of purchasing from AliExpress.

## Technical Demonstrations
- Matthew Komitsky presented his progress on the micro mouse robot, highlighting challenges with tiny components and the decisions around outsourcing PCB assembly to ensure quality and functionality.
