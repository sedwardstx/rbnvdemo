# Robot Builders Night Virtual for May 20th, 2025

## Introduction
The Robot Builders Night Virtual meeting on May 20th, 2025, focused on upcoming competitions, technical challenges in robotics, and discussions about the impact of recent tariffs on electronics sourcing. The session also featured updates on individual robot projects and broader technology trends.

## Main Discussion Points

### Roborama Competition
- **Roboama**: Scheduled for this Saturday with various competitions like quick trip, mini sumo, barrel racing, and six-can. Participants discussed logistics and strategies, including the importance of precise timing and navigation adjustments.
- **Rules and Setup**: Doug clarified rules for events such as barrel racing, proposing to extend the start line to accommodate robots better and considering additional waypoint markers.

### Technical Challenges and Innovations
- **Robot Development**: 
  - Several participants, including Dave Ackley, faced challenges with MicroPython's performance, especially on ESP32, favoring C/C++ for performance-intensive tasks.
  - Chris N. discussed migrating a ROS1 robot platform to ROS2, highlighting differences and challenges in code structure and execution between the two versions. 
  - Mike Williamson and Scott Gibson presented updates on their robots, focusing on improving accuracy and performance in reset challenges and competitions.

### AI Tools and Software
- **AI Coding Assistants**:
  - Discussion on using AI tools like LangChain and different chatbots for coding assistance. Members shared experiences with tools that suggest and implement code solutions, emphasizing the potential benefits for robotics programming.
- **Software Tools**:
  - Paul's foray into FoxGlove Viewer as an alternative for inspecting ROS messages, highlighting its superior performance over RQT Bag.

### Impact of Tariffs and Sourcing Difficulties
- **Tariff Concerns**: The current uncertainty about tariffs on Chinese imports has caused participants to hold off on purchasing electronics from China. Issues with shipping and increased tariffs were significant concerns.
- **Community Strategies**: Members like Scott Gibson shared experiences of tariff bypass strategies, such as sourcing from locations outside China or adjusting shipment plans.

### Industry Trends
- **Innovative Products**:
  - Discussion about the Kickstarter for the first personal 3D textured UV printer by Eufy, attracting significant interest and potential applications in various crafts.
  - New Eufy robotic mowers with advanced mapping and navigation features, offering promises for the consumer robotics market.
   
## Conclusions and Insights
- **Adaptation to New Technologies**: Transitioning to ROS2 and integrating AI tools require adjustments in coding practices but offer significant long-term benefits.
- **Competitive Preparation**: The upcoming Roboama is set to be a diverse and competitive event, with participants eager to demonstrate improvements in robot capabilities through precision and strategy.
- **Market Challenges**: The ongoing tariff issues highlight the need for strategic planning in sourcing components, particularly in the robotics field where Chinese suppliers are prevalent.
