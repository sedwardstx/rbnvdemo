# Robot Builders Night Virtual for March 4th, 2025

## Introduction
The virtual meetup held on March 4th, 2025, featured discussions ranging from robotics software platforms to hardware developments and troubleshooting challenges encountered by the participants. The meeting also incorporated discussions about sensor integration, robot reconstruction, and software simulation issues.

## Main Discussion Points

### OpenBot and App Inventor Exploration
- **Ray Casler** shared his experiences with OpenBot, encountering discrepancies between advertised features and available software on GitHub. The issue was resolved after new revisions were pushed to GitHub.
- There was a detailed discussion on using MIT's App Inventor to access Android phone sensors. However, limitations such as the absence of GPS data were noted.

### Reviving Roby the Robot
- **Paul Bouchier** provided updates on Roby, the resuscitation project involving servos and motor drivers for the DPRG mascot robot.
- **Mike Williamson** shared insights on improvements made to Roby, along with challenges such as missing software potentially hindering future developments.

### Robotics Sensor Technology
- Discussions included insights on the suitability of various LIDAR models for different settings, primarily weighing speed against accuracy.
- **Chris N** detailed his experiences with ROS's navigation stack, offering insights into dealing with LIDAR data warping caused by robot movements.

### New Robot Developments
- **Mike Williamson** showcased his new Roborama robot design and the strategy for sensor integration to improve performance.
- **Tom C - Hamilton, ON** shared advancements on his line-following robot, utilizing an ESP8266 and emphasizing practical applications of the technology.

## Conclusions and Insights
- There is a need for ongoing evaluation of sensor and robotics platform compatibility, focusing on resolving inconsistencies between documentation and real-world performance.
- The team has successfully revived Roby, showcasing community collaboration, though there remains an essential need to preserve and update legacy software and hardware configurations.
- The interplay between software simulation and real-world application continues to be a critical domain for roboticists, as accurate modeling can prevent real-world complications.
